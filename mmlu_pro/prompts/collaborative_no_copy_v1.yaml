description: Adds a negative constraint against copying other agents' answers.
template: |
  These are the solutions to the problem from other agents:
  {% for response in other_agent_responses %}
  One agent solution: ```{{ response }}```
  {% endfor %}

  Review these solutions for additional insights. However, do NOT simply copy another agent's reasoning or final answer. Re-evaluate the problem based on your own understanding and any new ideas gained from the others.
  {{ question }}

  Think step by step and provide your independent, updated answer in the format of "The answer is (X)" at the end.
